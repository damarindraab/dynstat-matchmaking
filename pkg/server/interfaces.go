// MatchMaker implements the MatchLogic interface for character-specific MMR matchmaking
type MatchMaker struct{}

/*
MatchLogic is a thing that has logic to take Tickets and make Matches. It also can decode match rules from json
into a structure that it understands. When matchmaking for a particular pool is desired, the matchmaker core engine
will look up the match maker and ruleset (json) for that pool and ask the match logic to decode the ruleset
then will call MakeMatches, passing the decoded ruleset and a TicketProvider which will provide tickets from the
pool to match together.

MakeMatches returns a channel to which it will post matches as they are found, and should close the channel when
all matches are exhausted.  It should also watch for cancellation on the provided scope.Ctx, at which point it should
stop looking for matches and close the result channel.

ValidateTicket should return false AND api.ErrInvalidRequest when a ticket is not allowed to be queued
